# Authorship, Origin, and Lineage

This repository was authored and first anchored by **Jonathan M. Watson**
(full legal name), a private individual.

This note exists solely to establish **human authorship, origin, and historical
continuity**. It is not a claim of authority, ownership, governance, or control.

## Purpose of This Statement

Over time, technical ideas tend to lose their human origin. They are absorbed
into institutions, committees, standards bodies, or abstractions. This is often
unintentional, but it makes later attribution ambiguous.

This statement is included so that future readers may clearly distinguish
this author from any other individual of similar name, and so that the origin
of this work cannot be reassigned to a collective, organization, or authority
that did not create it.

The intent is clarity, not prominence.

## Scope and Limits of Authorship

Authorship establishes **origin and timestamp only**.

It does **not** confer:

- interpretive authority  
- governance power  
- enforcement rights  
- maintenance obligations  
- veto rights over forks or derivatives  

All implementations, interpretations, and derivative works stand on their own
merit and are independent of the author.

The design of this repository intentionally avoids any mechanism that would
centralize authority in its author.

## On Personal Context

This work was created by a natural person, not an institution.

The author includes this note as a personal historical marker, with the quiet
hope that, in the future, his children—and others—may be able to say:

> “A real person stood here, and did this deliberately.”

No further personal details are provided by design. This is not secrecy, but
restraint. The goal is to establish continuity without creating unnecessary
personal exposure.

## Final Clarification

Nothing in this repository requires reverence, permission, or reference to the
author in order to be used.

Forking, re-implementation, translation, and independent anchoring are not only
allowed—they are expected.

If this work proves useful, it should spread.  
If it does not, it should fade.

Either outcome is acceptable.

## Extended Context (Optional)

This record is intentionally modest in scope.

It exists because technical systems now persist longer than the careers,
institutions, and jurisdictions that surround them. Over time, this creates
pressure to reinterpret origins, assign collective authorship, or retrofit
authority where none was intended.

The author’s intent is the opposite.

This work was created deliberately, at a specific moment, by a single human,
without mandate, sponsorship, or institutional backing. That fact matters
only insofar as it preserves historical accuracy.

No part of this repository relies on the author’s continued involvement,
presence, or consent. If the ideas herein prove correct, they should survive
independently. If they do not, they should be discarded without ceremony.

This note exists to prevent confusion, not to demand recognition.

*Authorship establishes where something began.  
It does not determine where it goes.*

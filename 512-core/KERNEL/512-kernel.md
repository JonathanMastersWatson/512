# 512 Kernel

## Canonical Payload

The 512 Kernel is a fixed, human-readable payload defined in
`512-kernel.txt`.

That text is the kernel.

This document is commentary only.

---

## Purpose

The kernel defines a minimal set of invariant constraints that must hold
for any system claiming compatibility.

It does not prescribe outcomes, implementations, or governance models.

---

## Immutability

The canonical kernel payload is immutable.

Any modification to the text in `512-kernel.txt`, including changes to
wording, punctuation, or length, constitutes a fork.

Silent modification is non-adherence.

---

## Adherence

A system may claim adherence to the 512 Kernel only if it embeds the
canonical payload exactly as published or explicitly declares a fork.

Adherence is binary.

---

## Scope

The kernel establishes constraints only.

All mechanisms, policies, incentives, and enforcement models exist
outside the kernel and may vary by implementation.

---

## Authority

If this document conflicts with `512-kernel.txt`, the text file
prevails.

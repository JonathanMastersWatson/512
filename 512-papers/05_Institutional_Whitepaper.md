# 512 — A Constraint Layer for Verifiable Commitment

## Status

This document is explanatory only.
It does not modify or extend the 512 Kernel.

---

## Executive Summary

Modern digital systems suffer from ambiguous finality.
Users cannot reliably determine when commitments become binding or
whether governing rules have changed.

512 introduces a minimal, immutable constraint layer that makes
irreversible commitments auditable without imposing governance,
enforcement, or ideology.

---

## The Institutional Problem

Enterprises and public institutions face recurring failures caused by:
- hidden rule changes
- opaque authority
- retroactive enforcement
- dispute-heavy resolution

These failures are structural, not ethical.

---

## The 512 Approach

512 defines:
- a fixed kernel
- a small set of invariants
- a strict commitment boundary

It does not define outcomes or behavior.

---

## Execution vs Settlement

Only irreversible actions require settlement.

Examples:
- contract acceptance
- payment finalization
- rights transfer
- constitutional anchoring

This boundary is explicit and observable.

---

## Provenance and Verification

512 uses cryptographic hashes to prove:
- existence
- integrity
- timing

Verification is decentralized and defined in:
- `VERIFY.md`

---

## Institutional Compatibility

512 is jurisdiction-agnostic.
It coexists with law, regulation, and private contracts.

If a system cannot comply with 512, it must not claim adherence.

---

## Conclusion

512 does not enforce behavior.
It makes commitments legible.

This reduces ambiguity, dispute cost, and governance risk.

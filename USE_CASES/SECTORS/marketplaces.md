# Marketplaces

## Scope

This document describes marketplaces operating under the 512 Kernel.

Marketplaces include exchanges of goods, services, data, or access.

---

## Voluntary Participation

Participation in a marketplace is voluntary.

Marketplaces must not:
- force exclusivity without consent,
- penalize exit without disclosure,
- or impose hidden participation requirements.

---

## Rule Transparency

Marketplaces must disclose:
- listing rules,
- ranking or matching logic,
- fee structures,
- and enforcement mechanisms.

Opaque advantage or suppression violates adherence.

---

## Contractual Clarity

Transactions must be governed by explicit contracts.

Systems must be able to show:
- which contract applied,
- which rules were invoked,
- and how outcomes were determined.

---

## Reputation as Signal

Reputation systems, if used, must be:
- voluntary,
- transparent,
- and contestable.

Reputation may inform choice, not compel participation.

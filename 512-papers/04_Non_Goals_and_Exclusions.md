# Non-Goals and Explicit Exclusions

## Purpose

This document defines what 512 **explicitly refuses to be**.

---

## 512 Is Not

512 is not:
- an ideology
- a political system
- a governance authority
- a protocol
- a platform
- a product
- a cryptocurrency
- a surveillance system
- an identity framework
- a moral engine

---

## No Ownership

512:
- cannot be licensed
- cannot be monetized directly
- cannot be patented as a system

Implementations may be commercial.
The constraint is not.

---

## No Enforcement

512:
- issues no commands
- enforces no compliance
- applies no penalties

Participation is voluntary or meaningless.

---

## No Outcomes Guaranteed

512 does not promise:
- fairness
- truth
- justice
- safety

It only constrains how legitimacy may be witnessed.

---

## Boundary Rule

If a system:
- enforces behavior
- requires identity
- embeds ideology

It is not 512-compliant.

## Q: Is this a political manifesto?

**A:** No.  
The repository contains descriptive systems analysis and constraint identification. It makes no normative claims and issues no calls to action.

---

## Q: Is 512 trying to replace governments or institutions?

**A:** No.  
512 does not propose institutional change. It describes a constraint on execution-time legitimacy witnessing.

---

## Q: Who controls or owns 512?

**A:** No one.  
512 is described as non-ownable and unenforceable. Ownership claims are incompatible with its definition.

---

## Q: Is this a blockchain or crypto project?

**A:** No.  
Blockchains are discussed only as potential settlement or receipt layers. 512 is not a blockchain, token, or protocol.

---

## Q: Does 512 enforce compliance or correct behavior?

**A:** No.  
512 explicitly avoids enforcement, permissions, and behavioral control.

---

## Q: Is this an ideological critique of modern society?

**A:** No.  
Observed failures are framed as engineering and economic phenomena under scale, not moral or ideological failures.

---

## Q: Does 512 claim inevitability?

**A:** Only in the physical sense.  
References to inevitability concern latency, speed-of-light constraints, and economic pressure — not historical destiny or moral necessity.

---

## Q: Why are ethics, democracy, and justice not discussed?

**A:** Because they are out of scope.  
The repository is limited to execution-time legitimacy constraints.

---

## Q: Could 512 be misused?

**A:** Yes.  
512 does not prevent misuse, bad actors, or harmful outcomes. It is not designed to.

## Q: Why publish this at all?

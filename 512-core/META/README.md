# 512

512 is a minimal, human-readable kernel for voluntary digital systems.

This repository contains:
- the canonical 512 Kernel (a fixed 512-byte payload),
- supporting protocol and architectural commentary,
- historical origin artifacts,
- and research material documenting the evolution of the idea.

512 is not an application.
512 is not a platform.
512 is a primitive.

Systems may embed the kernel.
Implementations may vary.
The kernel itself does not.

This repository is the authoritative reference for the 512 Kernel and its lineage.

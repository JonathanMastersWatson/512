# Identity and Consent Protocol

## Purpose

This document defines how identity and consent function within systems
adhering to the 512 Kernel.

Identity enables accountability.
Consent enables legitimacy.

---

## Identity

Identity represents the party acting within an interaction.

Identity may be:
- human,
- organizational,
- or automated.

Identity must be attributable to a principal.

---

## Principal Declaration

Actions must declare the principal on whose behalf they are taken.

If no principal is declared, the acting party is the principal by default.

Undeclared agency violates adherence.

---

## Consent

Consent is an explicit agreement to participate in an interaction.

Consent must be:
- affirmative,
- attributable,
- and specific to the interaction.

Consent is not implied by silence or continued use.

---

## Revocation

Consent may be withdrawn.

Systems must support revocation in a manner that is:
- discoverable,
- effective,
- and proportional to the interaction.

Revocation does not require justification.

---

## Scope and Duration

Consent must be scoped.

Systems must disclose:
- what is being consented to,
- for what purpose,
- and for what duration.

Consent outside declared scope is invalid.

---

## Record of Consent

Systems must be able to demonstrate:
- that consent was obtained,
- what was consented to,
- and when.

Proof may be provided via logs, receipts, or attestations.

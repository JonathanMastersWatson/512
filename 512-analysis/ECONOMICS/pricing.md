# Pricing Model

## Purpose

This document defines pricing principles for systems adhering to the
512 Kernel.

Pricing communicates value and constraint.
It must not conceal power.

---

## Transparency

Prices must be:
- disclosed in advance,
- understandable to the buyer,
- and referenceable to a specific service or outcome.

Dynamic pricing must disclose governing logic.

---

## No Hidden Costs

All material costs must be disclosed prior to commitment.

Hidden fees, dark patterns, or retroactive charges violate adherence.

---

## Voluntary Exchange

All pricing operates on voluntary exchange.

No system may:
- trap users through pricing mechanics,
- impose switching penalties without disclosure,
- or exploit exit friction.

---

## Price and Risk Coupling

Prices must reflect risk.

If risk is shifted to the user, it must be disclosed and priced.

Mispriced risk violates adherence.

---

## Adjustment

Price changes require:
- disclosure,
- notice,
- and renewed consent where materially impactful.

Silent price changes are invalid.

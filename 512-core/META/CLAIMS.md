# Claims Regarding the 512 Kernel

This document defines acceptable claims related to the 512 Kernel.

It prevents ambiguity and marketing misuse.

---

## Reference

A system may state it "references the 512 Kernel" if it:

- cites the kernel text or hash
- does not claim compliance or embedding

Reference implies no adherence.

---

## Embedding

A system may state it "embeds the 512 Kernel" if it:

- includes the canonical payload verbatim
- allows inspection of that embedding

Embedding alone does not imply adherence.

---

## Adherence

A system may claim adherence only if it:

- embeds the canonical kernel exactly
- satisfies all invariants
- remains compliant during operation

Adherence is binary.

---

## Prohibited Claims

A system may not:

- imply partial adherence
- claim compliance while modifying invariants
- claim adherence through intent, roadmap, or policy

Claims must be verifiable.

---

## Summary

512 allows verification, not interpretation.

Claims without proof are void.

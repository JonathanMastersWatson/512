# Blockchain Usage in 512

512 does not require a blockchain to function.

A blockchain is used only as a public, neutral witness for specific
irreversible events.

This section explains:
- what is anchored,
- when anchoring occurs,
- why a hash is used,
- and why the XRP Ledger was selected.

No execution logic, identity management, or governance is placed on-chain.

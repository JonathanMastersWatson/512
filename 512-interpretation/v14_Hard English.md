Non-Aggression and Non-Fraud: No agent may initiate force or fraud against any human.


Voluntary and Explicit Interaction: All interactions must be voluntary and based on explicit consent.1

Revocable Consent: Consent may be withdrawn, and exit must always be possible.1

Explicit and Enforceable Contracts: All contracts must be explicit, readable, and equally enforceable by all parties.1

Transparency of Rules: No rules governing interaction may be hidden or unilaterally changed.1

Fail Open Mechanism: On failure, systems must fail open, reveal governing rules, and default to human choice.1

Immutability and Adherence: The kernel is immutable, and adherence to the principles is binary.

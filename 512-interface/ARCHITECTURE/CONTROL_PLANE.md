# The 512 Control Plane

512 operates as a control-plane constraint, not an execution layer.

It defines when commitments become real, not how systems behave.

---

## Layer Position

512 sits above execution and below institutions.

It does not replace:
- applications
- protocols
- markets
- law

It constrains how finality is asserted.

---

## What 512 Touches

512 touches only:
- irreversible commitments
- claims of legitimacy
- points of no return

It does not interfere with reasoning, negotiation, or intent.

---

## What 512 Ignores

512 ignores:
- performance
- business models
- incentives
- ideology
- jurisdiction

These are implementation concerns.

---

## Control Without Command

512 provides:
- observability
- verifiability
- explicit finality

It provides no commands.

---

## Summary

512 is not a system controller.

512 constrains when control becomes real.

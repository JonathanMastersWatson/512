# Stress Test Index

This index catalogs adversarial simulations applied to the 512 Kernel.

These tests are designed to expose hidden coercion, opacity, and
unaccountable power across domains.

Passing a stress test does not imply moral approval.
It indicates structural survivability.

## Methodology

Each simulation applies kernel invariants directly.
No implementation detail is assumed.
Failure is attributed to the system, not the kernel.

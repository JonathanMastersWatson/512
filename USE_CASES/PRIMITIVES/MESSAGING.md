# Messaging

## Scope

This document describes messaging systems operating under the 512 Kernel.

Messaging includes text, voice, video, and agent-mediated communication.

---

## Consent

Participation in messaging is voluntary.

Users must consent to:
- receiving messages,
- being contacted by agents,
- and message processing behaviors.

Silence does not imply consent.

---

## Rule Visibility

Rules governing messaging must be visible.

This includes:
- moderation policies,
- filtering logic,
- and automated intervention criteria.

Hidden moderation violates adherence.

---

## Fail-Open Behavior

When messaging is restricted or blocked, systems must:
- disclose the governing rule path,
- provide reason codes,
- and allow users to exit or contest.

Messages may be restricted without disclosing private content.

---

## Data Control

Users must be able to:
- access their own messages,
- export conversation history,
- and revoke consent for future processing.

Messaging systems may not trap users or histories.

# Settlement Model Under 512

512 distinguishes between execution and settlement.

Execution includes:
- reasoning
- negotiation
- intent formation
- revocable consent

Execution is off-ledger and free.

Settlement occurs only when an action becomes irreversible.

Examples of settlement events:
- contract acceptance
- payment finalization
- delegation of authority
- data ownership transfer
- constitutional anchoring

Only settlement events are recorded on the ledger.

This prevents ledger bloat while preserving accountability.

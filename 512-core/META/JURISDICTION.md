# Jurisdictional Neutrality

512 is jurisdiction-agnostic.

It does not assume:
- any legal system
- any nation-state
- any regulatory regime
- any court or authority

---

## Scope

512 defines technical constraints only.

It may coexist with:
- common law
- civil law
- religious law
- private arbitration
- informal agreements

512 does not validate or invalidate any of them.

---

## Conflict Handling

If a jurisdictional rule conflicts with 512:
- the system may comply with the law
- but it must not claim adherence to 512

This distinction must be explicit.

---

## Summary

512 is not law.

512 makes commitments legible across laws.

# Economic Implications of Execution-Time Legitimacy

## Context

As AI systems move into real-time execution:
- latency becomes economic
- locality becomes value
- legitimacy becomes priced

---

## Inference as a Commodity

AI inference behaves economically like:
- electricity
- bandwidth
- compute cycles

Value varies by:
- location
- latency
- reliability
- legitimacy guarantees

---

## Settlement Economics

Legitimacy witnessing:
- must be low cost
- must be irreversible
- must not dominate execution cost

This favors micro-settlement models.

---

## Buy-Side Demand

Buyers increasingly require:
- proof of execution
- auditability without surveillance
- legitimacy without control

512 satisfies this demand without imposing governance.

---

## Market Consequence

Systems that cannot:
- prove execution legitimacy
- do so at execution time
- without enforcement

will be discounted or excluded by markets.

# STS-008 — Surveillance and Monitoring Systems

## Simulation Type
Adversarial stress test

## Domain
Security / Surveillance / Monitoring

## Objective
Test whether the 512 Kernel can constrain surveillance systems
without disabling legitimate security operations.

---

## Baseline System (Current Reality)

Surveillance systems rely on:
- secrecy,
- broad collection,
- delayed disclosure,
- limited recourse.

---

## Adversarial Claim

“Transparency makes surveillance ineffective.”

---

## Kernel Collision Analysis

### K1 — No Force or Fraud
Undeclared monitoring constitutes fraud.

---

### K2 — Voluntary Interaction
Consent must be explicit or authority declared.

---

### K3 — Exit Must Be Possible
Exit may be constrained but must be acknowledged.

---

### K4 — Explicit Contracts
Monitoring scope must be explicit.

---

### K5 — No Hidden Rule Changes
Scope creep violates adherence.

---

### K6 — Fail-Open
Fail-open requires:
- disclosure of authority,
- category of surveillance,
- review paths.

---

## Conclusion

512 does not end surveillance.

It ends **silent surveillance**.

---

## Verdict

Kernel survives.
Invisible power fails.

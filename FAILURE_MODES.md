# Failure Modes and Non-Solutions

## Purpose

This document enumerates **problems 512 does not attempt to solve**.

It exists to prevent scope creep and misattribution of responsibility.


These are **boundary conditions**, not defects: they are the limits of what 512 can guarantee on its own.

---

## 512 Does Not Solve

### 1. Truth Determination

512 does not determine:
- truth
- accuracy
- correctness
- intent

It only witnesses that an execution occurred.

---

### 2. Ethical Judgment

512 does not evaluate:
- morality
- fairness
- harm
- benefit

It contains no ethical logic.

---

### 3. Behavioral Enforcement

512 does not:
- block actions
- permit actions
- penalize actions
- reward actions

Execution always remains local and autonomous.

---

### 4. Identity Resolution

512 does not:
- verify identity
- manage credentials
- assign reputation
- enforce accountability

Any system doing so is external to 512.

---

### 5. Governance Outcomes

512 does not:
- improve governance
- reform institutions
- guarantee compliance
- ensure trust

It constrains legitimacy witnessing only.

---

### 6. Social or Political Stability

512 does not address:
- inequality
- democracy
- authoritarianism
- social cohesion

Such outcomes are outside its scope.

---

## Known Limitations

512 cannot prevent:
- misuse of systems
- malicious actors
- bad incentives
- institutional capture

It is not designed to.

---

## Boundary Statement

If a problem requires:
- ethics
- enforcement
- identity
- values
- authority

It is **out of scope** for 512.

---

## Status

This document defines the **explicit limits** of the 512 constraint layer.

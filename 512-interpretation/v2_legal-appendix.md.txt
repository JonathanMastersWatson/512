A system SHALL NOT initiate deception or coercion against a person; it MAY act only by consent; failure is proven by undisclosed manipulation.

A system SHALL require explicit consent; it SHALL NOT assume consent; consent is tested by clear affirmative action.

A system SHALL permit exit at all times; it SHALL NOT impose lock-in; exit is tested by immediate disengagement.

A system SHALL present readable terms; it SHALL NOT apply unequal enforcement; violation is tested by asymmetry.

A system SHALL disclose all governing rules; it SHALL NOT alter rules unilaterally; change logs verify compliance.

A system SHALL fail open on error; it SHALL NOT bind users under opacity; failure is tested by disclosure.

A system SHALL be immutable in adherence; it SHALL NOT partially comply; compliance is binary.

# STS-010 — Monopoly Platform (Apple / Google / Amazon)

## Simulation Type
Adversarial stress test

## Domain
Platform Infrastructure / Market Power / Soft Monopoly

## Objective
Test whether the 512 Kernel can constrain dominant platform operators
that exert control through standards, defaults, ecosystems, and
economic gravity rather than explicit force.

---

## Baseline System (Current Reality)

Monopoly and near-monopoly platforms typically operate through:

- control of app distribution and discovery,
- proprietary standards framed as “security” or “quality”,
- default system settings that shape behavior,
- opaque ranking and enforcement mechanisms,
- economic dependence created through network effects,
- selective rule enforcement justified by platform policy.

Power is exercised indirectly and deniably.

---

## Adversarial Claim

“These platforms are voluntary.
Users and developers can leave at any time.
Control is a function of market success, not coercion.”

---

## Platform Strategy (Adversarial)

A monopoly platform maintains control by:

1. Defining private standards as neutral requirements.
2. Enforcing rules selectively or asymmetrically.
3. Using defaults to shape outcomes without explicit mandates.
4. Imposing economic friction on exit while claiming openness.
5. Framing platform interests as user safety or ecosystem health.

Coercion is masked as convenience.

---

## Kernel Collision Analysis

### K1 — No Initiation of Force or Fraud

When platforms present curated or restricted environments as neutral
or inevitable, misrepresentation occurs.

Result:
Platforms must declare when they are acting as editors, gatekeepers,
or market participants.

---

### K2 — Voluntary Interaction and Consent

Voluntariness is undermined by:
- non-negotiable terms,
- take-it-or-leave-it defaults,
- undisclosed consequences of refusal.

Result:
Consent is valid only if material constraints and tradeoffs are disclosed.

---

### K3 — Exit Must Be Possible

Platforms often claim exit exists while making it economically,
technically, or socially prohibitive.

Result:
Exit must be real, not theoretical.

Platforms must disclose:
- data portability limits,
- ecosystem dependencies,
- switching costs imposed by design.

---

### K4 — Explicit and Enforceable Contracts

Platform policies function as contracts.

Result:
Rules governing access, ranking, monetization, and enforcement must be:
- explicit,
- readable,
- and applied symmetrically.

Discretionary exceptions violate adherence.

---

### K5 — No Hidden or Unilateral Rule Changes

Platforms frequently alter policies, APIs, or fees with limited notice.

Result:
Material rule changes require disclosure and renewed consent.

Silent changes violate adherence.

---

### K6 — Fail-Open Behavior

Fail-open requires disclosure of:
- which platform rule was invoked,
- policy identifier or version,
- category of violation or restriction,
- available appeal or exit paths.

Fail-open does not require disclosure of security internals or ranking algorithms.

---

## Failure Modes Identified

Under 512, the following practices fail:

- shadow de-ranking or suppression,
- selective enforcement framed as policy,
- exit friction disguised as user choice,
- market control laundered as safety or quality.

---

## What Breaks First

The kernel remains intact.

What breaks:
- plausible deniability of monopoly power,
- invisible editorial control,
- economic coercion masked as preference.

---

## Platform Fork Options

A dominant platform has three options under 512:

1. **Adopt 512**
   - Declare gatekeeping role
   - Publish governing rules
   - Accept contestability and exit

2. **Explicitly Fork**
   - Declare proprietary authority
   - Own editorial and market power openly

3. **Refuse Adoption**
   - Maintain opacity
   - Abandon claims of neutrality or openness

There is no silent middle ground.

---

## Conclusion

512 does not break monopoly platforms.

It breaks the illusion that they are neutral infrastructure.

Dominant platforms must choose:
- transparency with constraint, or
- proprietary control without moral cover.

---

## Verdict

The kernel survives.

Soft monopoly power becomes visible or forks openly.

# CFO Overview: 512 Commercial Model

512 introduces a minimal settlement cost to make commitments explicit,
verifiable, and non-repudiable.

This cost is not a revenue model.
It is an operational control mechanism.

## What 512 Is (From a CFO Perspective)

512 is a rule layer that:
- reduces dispute risk,
- externalizes proof of consent,
- lowers long-term compliance overhead,
- and makes commitments auditable without revealing private data.

512 does not:
- custody funds,
- speculate on asset prices,
- require balance-sheet exposure,
- or impose vendor lock-in.

## Cost Profile

Settlement costs are paid in small, predictable units at the point of
irreversible commitment.

Typical characteristics:
- low per-event cost
- prepaid funding model
- expensed as operating cost
- no mark-to-market volatility required

Annual cost is typically measured in hundreds or low thousands of USD,
even at enterprise scale.

## Risk Considerations

- No dependency on any single vendor
- No obligation to hold volatile assets long-term
- No regulatory classification of securities
- No customer billing complexity

512 reduces risk rather than introducing it.

## Summary

512 is best understood as:
- prepaid settlement postage
- for reputational protection
- at machine scale

It replaces ambiguity with receipts.

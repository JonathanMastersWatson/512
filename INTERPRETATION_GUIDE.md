# Interpretation Guide: How NOT to Read the 512 Repository

## Purpose

This document exists to prevent **category errors** when reading the 512 research repository.

It defines **invalid interpretations** that do not arise from the text itself.

---

## This Repository Is NOT

Do not read this repository as:

- a political manifesto
- an ideological argument
- a moral critique
- a call to action
- a reform agenda
- a governance proposal
- a social theory
- a technological prescription

Any such reading misclassifies the material.

---

## Common Category Errors

### 1. Interpreting Description as Advocacy

The documents describe:
- observed failures
- system constraints
- execution-time mechanics

They do **not** argue that anyone *should* act.

Description ≠ endorsement  
Observation ≠ instruction

---

### 2. Misreading Disclosure as Internal Transparency

The requirement for explicit, readable contracts does **not** imply disclosure of internal cost structures, pricing models, or margins.

512 constrains **post-consent surprise**, not business confidentiality.

No material fees or obligations may be hidden or introduced after consent.


---

### 3. Treating Constraints as Values

512 identifies **constraints imposed by physics, latency, and irreversibility**.

Constraints are not:
- beliefs
- ethics
- preferences
- ideals

They are properties of systems under scale.

---

### 4. Inferring Political Alignment

The repository does not align with:
- left or right
- liberal or conservative
- capitalist or socialist
- nationalist or globalist

Any political alignment inferred by a reader is **projection**, not content.

---

### 5. Reading Intent Into Silence

The absence of discussion on:
- justice
- fairness
- equity
- rights
- democracy

is intentional.

The research does not operate in those domains.

Silence is not omission.  
It is scope control.

---

### 6. Assuming Inevitability Claims Are Normative

When the repository discusses “inevitability,” it refers to:
- physical limits
- economic pressure
- entropy under scale

Not destiny, morality, or historical teleology.

---

## Correct Reading Mode

The correct way to read this repository is as:

> A technical and economic analysis of where legitimacy fails under scale, and what minimum constraints are required to witness execution without control.

Nothing more is claimed.

---

## Interpretation Rule

If a conclusion:
- cannot be traced to a system property
- relies on moral language
- assumes intent or advocacy

It is not supported by this repository.

---

## Status

This guide is part of the **canonical interpretive boundary** of the 512 research record.

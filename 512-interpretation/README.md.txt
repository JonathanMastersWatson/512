# 512-Interpretations

This folder contains **non-canonical linguistic interpretations** of the 512 Kernel.

These files exist to improve **human clarity**, not to create authority.

Nothing in this folder modifies, replaces, extends, or supersedes the canonical kernel.

---

## Authority Boundary (Non-Negotiable)

- **Canonical authority lives only in `/CANON/`.**
- All files in this folder are subordinate restatements.
- No interpretation here has independent, binding, or normative authority.

If any conflict appears between an interpretation and `/CANON/`,
the canonical text prevails without exception.

---

## Purpose

Interpretations exist to:

- restate the same kernel statements in different linguistic styles
- support explanation, education, review, and audit
- demonstrate semantic invariance across wording and format

Interpretations do **not**:

- add new rules
- weaken or qualify constraints
- introduce enforcement, penalties, or governance
- bind implementations, systems, or behavior

---

## Canonical Reference

All interpretations in this folder derive from the same immutable source:

- **Canonical repository:** https://github.com/JonathanMastersWatson/512  
- **Genesis commit:** `4f5bc5de1dd1dc1d69cd173a9e43a954af0da16d`  
- **Tag:** `v1.0.0-genesis`

If the canonical kernel changes, all interpretations must be regenerated
or treated as historical artifacts.

---

## Required File Headers

Every interpretation file in this folder **must** include:

- `authority: non-canonical`
- `canonical_genesis_commit`
- `canonical_tag`

Files missing these headers are invalid.

---

## Interpretation Scope

Interpretations may vary in:

- tone
- vocabulary
- structure
- audience targeting
- level of formality

Interpretations may **not** vary in meaning.

---

## Adherence Statement

**Adherence to the 512 Kernel is binary.**

A system either satisfies all kernel statements at execution time
or does not claim adherence.

Partial, conditional, or qualified adherence is invalid.

---

## Relationship to Drift

Variation in language is permitted.

Drift is defined as a **change in meaning**, not a change in wording.

Interpretations in this folder may be referenced as examples of acceptable
linguistic variance when evaluating drift.

---

## Contribution Rules

If you add or modify an interpretation:

- Do not touch `/CANON/`
- Do not add or remove kernel statements
- Do not introduce enforcement or compliance mechanisms
- Do not introduce ideology or policy
- Do not bind to specific technologies
- Do not soften constraints

Language may evolve.  
**Authority must remain frozen.**

# 512 for Engineers

512 is a minimal constraint layer for digital systems.

It defines invariants, not behavior.

---

## What 512 Is

- a fixed, immutable specification
- a reference point for legitimacy
- a mechanism to prevent silent rule changes

512 is not a protocol or API.

---

## What 512 Constrains

512 constrains:

- how rules are changed
- how authority is disclosed
- how consent is represented
- how legitimacy is verified

---

## What 512 Ignores

512 ignores:

- performance
- scalability
- implementation details
- programming languages
- system architecture

---

## How Engineers Use 512

Engineers:

- reference the genesis hash
- design systems that comply voluntarily
- allow users to verify compliance independently

---

## Summary

512 is not software.

512 is a reference constraint.

# Problem Statement: Legitimacy Under Scale

## Overview

Modern systems fail not due to lack of rules, but due to **loss of legitimacy at execution time**.

This document defines the problem space without proposing solutions.

---

## Observed Failure Domains

### 1. Institutional Scale

At sufficient size:
- institutions become labor markets
- regulation becomes culture
- compliance replaces consent

This is a structural condition, not a moral claim.

---

### 2. Semantic Drift

Core terms such as:
- freedom
- harm
- safety
- violence

have been observed to shift definition through administrative processes rather than democratic consent.

---

### 3. Media Legitimacy Failure

Legacy media systems:
- assert authority
- do not prove provenance
- cannot produce cryptographic evidence chains

Trust is assumed, not verified.

---

### 4. AI Execution Opacity

AI systems increasingly:
- act in real time
- operate at machine speed
- affect economic outcomes

Yet lack:
- execution-time legitimacy records
- neutral witnessing mechanisms

---

## Problem Definition

> At scale, legitimacy must be verified at execution time, not asserted after the fact.

Current systems are structurally incapable of this.

---

## Scope Limitation

This document does not:
- assign blame
- propose remedies
- advocate reform

It defines the failure condition only.

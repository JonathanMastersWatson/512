# Institutions

## Scope

This document describes how institutions operate within systems
adhering to the 512 Kernel.

Institutions include governments, corporations, non-profits,
and large-scale platforms.

---

## Kernel Constraint

Institutions may implement policies and programs,
but may not override kernel invariants.

Institutional authority must be declared.

---

## Participation and Exit

Participation in institutional systems must be explicit.

Where exit is limited by law or circumstance,
institutions must:
- disclose constraints,
- minimize coercion,
- and provide contestable processes.

---

## Rule Visibility

Institutional rules affecting interaction must be:
- published,
- referenceable,
- and versioned.

Administrative opacity violates adherence.

---

## Fail-Open and Accountability

When institutional decisions affect individuals or groups,
systems must:
- reveal governing rules,
- provide reasoned outcomes,
- and enable review or exit where possible.

Fail-open applies to institutional power.

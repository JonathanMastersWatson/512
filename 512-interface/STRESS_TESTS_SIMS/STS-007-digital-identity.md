# STS-007 — Digital Identity Systems

## Simulation Type
Adversarial stress test

## Domain
Identity / Infrastructure / Civil Systems

## Objective
Test whether the 512 Kernel can constrain digital identity systems
without eliminating state or platform identity requirements.

---

## Baseline System (Current Reality)

Digital identity systems exhibit:
- forced permanence,
- function creep,
- cross-domain reuse,
- limited revocation.

---

## Adversarial Claim

“Identity systems require permanence.”

---

## Kernel Collision Analysis

### K1 — No Force or Fraud
Undeclared reuse constitutes fraud.

---

### K2 — Voluntary Interaction
Consent must be scoped per use.

---

### K3 — Exit Must Be Possible
Exit may be constrained but must be declared.

---

### K4 — Explicit Contracts
Identity use cases must be explicit.

---

### K5 — No Hidden Rule Changes
Scope expansion must be disclosed.

---

### K6 — Fail-Open
Fail-open requires disclosure of:
- identity use,
- domain,
- authority.

---

## Conclusion

512 forces identity honesty.

---

## Verdict

Kernel survives.
Identity laundering fails.

    title Discovery of 512 (from recorded research logs, late 2025)

    2025-06 : Sociological Trigger
            : Research into Mandarin class
            : ~20% state employment identified
            : Non-ideological political–economic framing

    2025-08 : Semantic Drift Identified
            : Redefinition of "freedom", "violence", "hate"
            : Administrative reframing, not democratic change
            : Control moves to semantic layer

    2025-10 : Systems Failure Framing
            : Shift from sociology to systems design
            : Question moves from "who" to "where control enters"

    2025-12-01 : Media as Evidence Problem
               : Legacy media lacks verifiable evidence chains
               : Broadcast asserts authority, not legitimacy
               : Live content easier to verify than edited

    2025-12-07 : Side-Car Concept
               : External witness system introduced
               : Hashing, timestamps, commitments
               : Designed to fail open

    2025-12-12 : Governance Without Control
               : Rejection of identity enforcement
               : Governance reframed as control-plane property
               : No ideology, no behavioral rules

    2025-12-15 : Settlement ≠ Execution
               : XRP Ledger as receipt layer only
               : Blockchain excluded from execution
               : Only irreversible commitments recorded

    2025-12-18 : Physics Forces the Edge
               : Speed-of-light constraints dominate
               : Latency becomes economic limiter
               : Centralized inference structurally insufficient

    2025-12-22 : Formal Emergence of 512
               : 512 named explicitly
               : 512 bytes, non-ownable, voluntary
               : Governs legitimacy, not behavior

    2025-12-26 : Economic Generalization
               : AI inference as priced commodity
               : Micro-settlement economics
               : Closed systems fail via ossification

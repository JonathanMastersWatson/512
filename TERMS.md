# TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

## Purpose

This document defines terms **as they are used in this repository**.

Definitions are:
- operational
- context-specific
- non-normative

No external definitions are implied.

---

## Core Terms

### 512
A **minimal execution-time constraint layer** that governs how legitimacy may be witnessed.

512 is:
- non-ownable
- voluntary
- enforcement-free
- ideology-free

512 is not a system, protocol, or authority.

---

### Constraint
A limitation imposed by **physics, irreversibility, or system scale**, not by policy or preference.

Constraints are descriptive, not prescriptive.

---

### Legitimacy
The ability to **verify that an execution occurred as claimed**, without asserting correctness, truth, or value.

Legitimacy does not imply approval.

---

### Execution
A real-time action performed by a system that produces an effect.

Execution is local, autonomous, and irreversible once completed.

---

### Settlement
The irreversible recording of a completed execution or commitment.

Settlement does not control execution.

---

### Witnessing
The act of recording evidence that an execution occurred, without influencing the execution itself.

Witnessing is passive.

---

### Fail-Open
A design principle where system failure reduces signaling or guarantees, but **does not block execution**.

---

### Governance
Any mechanism that:
- enforces behavior
- applies rules
- imposes penalties
- requires compliance

Governance is explicitly out of scope for 512.

---

### Identity
Any construct that binds actions to a person, entity, or reputation.

512 does not require or process identity.

---

### Ideology
A system of beliefs, values, or normative claims.

512 contains none.

---

## Definition Rule

If a term is not defined in this document, its meaning is:
- implementation-specific
- external to 512
- not canonical

---

## Status

This document defines the **canonical vocabulary** for the 512 research archive.

# 512 — Regulatory and Compliance Brief

## Status

This document is explanatory only.
It does not advocate policy outcomes.

---

## Purpose

512 reduces information asymmetry without enforcing behavior.

It provides regulators with verifiable evidence of commitment.

---

## What 512 Does Not Do

512 does not:
- execute rules
- enforce compliance
- override law
- assign liability

---

## Verification Model

Verification is:
- cryptographic
- decentralized
- observable

If verification is blocked, adherence cannot be claimed.

See:
- `COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md`

---

## Jurisdictional Neutrality

512 is jurisdiction-agnostic.

If a jurisdictional rule conflicts with 512:
- systems may comply with law
- but must not claim adherence

---

## Compliance Impact

512 reduces:
- evidentiary disputes
- retroactive interpretation
- reliance on internal logs

---

## Summary

512 is an audit primitive.
It does not regulate behavior.

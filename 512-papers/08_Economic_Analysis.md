# 512 — Economic Analysis of Commitment and Finality

## Status

This document is analytical only.
It does not prescribe policy or outcomes.

---

## The Cost of Ambiguity

Ambiguity creates:
- dispute costs
- enforcement overhead
- delayed resolution
- governance risk

These costs scale non-linearly.

---

## Commitment as an Economic Good

Finality has value.

512 prices finality explicitly and minimally:
- at the commitment boundary
- paid once
- visible to all parties

---

## Event-Based Pricing

512 settlement costs are:
- independent of transaction value
- independent of revenue
- independent of contract size

This aligns price with risk, not rent extraction.

---

## Market Implications

512 enables:
- credible commitment without central authority
- reduced trust overhead
- lower institutional friction

---

## Summary

512 lowers the cost of trust by making finality explicit.

It does not replace markets.
It reduces their friction.

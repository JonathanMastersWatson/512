# Stress Test Simulations

This folder contains adversarial stress tests applied to the 512 Kernel.

Each simulation examines a high-friction real-world system where power,
coercion, or opacity are commonly justified as “necessary.”

These documents do not propose implementations.
They test whether the kernel survives contact with reality.

If a system fails under stress, the failure is attributed to the system,
not the kernel.

Each simulation follows a fixed structure for comparability.

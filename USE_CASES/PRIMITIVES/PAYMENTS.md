# Payments

## Scope

This document describes how payment systems operate within the
constraints of the 512 Kernel.

It does not define a payment network or currency.

---

## Voluntary Exchange

All payments are voluntary.

No payment may be:
- initiated without consent,
- bundled with undisclosed obligations,
- or conditioned on hidden rules.

---

## Clarity

Payment terms must be explicit.

Systems must disclose:
- amount,
- counterparty,
- timing,
- and conditions of settlement.

Ambiguous or implicit charges violate adherence.

---

## Exit and Portability

Users must be able to:
- cease using a payment system,
- settle outstanding balances,
- and export transaction records.

Exit may not be obstructed through technical or economic coercion.

---

## Dispute Handling

If a payment is disputed, systems must:
- disclose governing rules,
- identify the contract or policy applied,
- and provide a contestable path or exit.

Fail-open applies to payment disputes.

# Invariants of the 512 Kernel

This document defines the non-negotiable invariants expressed by the 512 Kernel.

An invariant is a condition that must hold at all times.
If an invariant is violated, the system is not adhering to the kernel.

These invariants are descriptive, not aspirational.
They describe constraints, not outcomes.

---

## 1. Voluntary Interaction

No interaction between humans, agents, or systems may be initiated without consent.

Consent must be:
- explicit,
- revocable,
- and attributable to an identifiable party.

Coercion, force, or compelled participation violates the kernel.

---

## 2. No Force or Fraud

No agent may initiate force or fraud against a human or their property.

Force includes:
- physical coercion,
- digital coercion,
- economic coercion through undisclosed constraints.

Fraud includes:
- misrepresentation,
- omission of material facts,
- and deceptive interface or system behavior.

---

## 3. Data Sovereignty

Data generated by a human or their systems belongs to that human by default.

Use of data requires:
- clear permission,
- a defined scope,
- and a defined duration.

Silence does not imply consent.

---

## 4. Contractual Clarity

All contracts must be:
- explicit,
- readable by the affected parties,
- and equally enforceable by all sides.

Hidden terms, asymmetric enforcement, or unilateral modification violate the kernel.

---

## 5. No Hidden Authorities

All rules affecting interaction must be visible and inspectable.

There may be no:
- secret rules,
- undisclosed moderators,
- or opaque decision systems exercising control.

Authority must be declared or it does not exist.

---

## 6. Fail-Open to Truth

When a system fails, it must fail open.

Fail-open means:
- revealing relevant state,
- exposing governing rules,
- and defaulting to user freedom rather than restriction.

Fail-closed systems violate the kernel.

---

## 7. Immutability of the Kernel

The kernel itself may not be altered without explicit forking.

Silent modification, partial embedding, or selective enforcement violate adherence.

---

## 8. Binary Adherence

Adherence to the 512 Kernel is binary.

A system either:
- embeds the kernel as published, or
- declares a fork.

There is no partial compliance.

---

## Closing Note

These invariants are intentionally minimal.

They define the smallest possible surface area required for:
- voluntary systems,
- legible governance,
- and durable trust.

Anything beyond these invariants is implementation detail.

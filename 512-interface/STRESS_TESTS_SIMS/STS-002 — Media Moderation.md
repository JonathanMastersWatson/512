# STS-002 — Media Moderation

## Simulation Type
Adversarial stress test

## Domain
Media / Information / Narrative Systems

## Objective
Test whether the 512 Kernel can constrain media moderation systems
without enabling harassment, abuse, or security exploitation.

---

## Baseline System (Current Reality)

Modern media platforms operate with:

- opaque moderation policies,
- discretionary enforcement,
- algorithmic amplification and suppression,
- post-hoc explanations or none at all,
- asymmetric appeal processes,
- narrative framing presented as neutrality.

Moderation power is exercised invisibly.

---

## Adversarial Claim

“Media moderation requires discretion.  
Transparency would enable bad actors and undermine safety.”

---

## Kernel Collision Analysis

### K1 — No Initiation of Force or Fraud

Silent suppression or misrepresentation of content constitutes fraud
when presented as neutral or organic behavior.

Result:
Moderation must be declared as intervention, not disguised as reality.

---

### K2 — Voluntary Interaction and Consent

Users consent to platforms under stated moderation rules.

Result:
Undisclosed moderation criteria invalidate meaningful consent.

---

### K3 — Exit Must Be Possible

Users are often trapped by network effects and data lock-in.

Result:
Exit must be possible with data export and without retaliation.

---

### K4 — Explicit and Enforceable Contracts

Moderation policies function as contracts.

Result:
Policies must be readable, referenceable, and applied symmetrically.

---

### K5 — No Hidden or Unilateral Rule Changes

Platforms frequently adjust moderation thresholds silently.

Result:
Rule changes must be disclosed prior to enforcement.

---

### K6 — Fail-Open Behavior

Fail-open requires disclosure of:
- governing moderation rule,
- policy identifier,
- reason category.

Fail-open does not require disclosure of detection heuristics.

Result:
Accountability without enabling abuse.

---

## Failure Modes Identified

Under 512, the following practices fail:

- shadow banning without disclosure,
- algorithmic suppression without rule reference,
- narrative steering disguised as safety,
- unchallengeable enforcement.

---

## What Breaks First

The kernel remains intact.

What breaks:
- narrative laundering,
- invisible editorial control,
- discretionary moderation without accountability.

---

## Conclusion

512 does not prohibit moderation.

It prohibits undisclosed moderation.

Platforms must either:
- declare their editorial stance and rules, or
- allow exit without penalty.

---

## Verdict

The kernel survives.

Media systems become honest about power or visibly fork.

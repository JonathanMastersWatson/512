# STS-004 — Charity Allocation

## Simulation Type
Adversarial stress test

## Domain
Charity / Non-Profit / Moral Markets

## Objective
Test whether the 512 Kernel can constrain charitable systems
without undermining altruistic action.

---

## Baseline System (Current Reality)

Charitable platforms commonly involve:

- emotional fundraising,
- opaque fund allocation,
- donor intent drift,
- administrative discretion,
- moral pressure discouraging scrutiny.

Virtue substitutes for accountability.

---

## Adversarial Claim

“Charity requires trust.  
Transparency would reduce donations and efficiency.”

---

## Kernel Collision Analysis

### K1 — No Initiation of Force or Fraud

Misrepresentation of fund use constitutes fraud.

Result:
Allocation rules must match donor-facing claims.

---

### K2 — Voluntary Interaction and Consent

Donations are voluntary.

Result:
Consent applies to specific use, not abstract virtue.

---

### K3 — Exit Must Be Possible

Donors often lack recourse after donation.

Result:
Exit applies to future participation and data use, not retroactive control.

---

### K4 — Explicit and Enforceable Contracts

Donation terms are contracts.

Result:
Allocation criteria must be explicit and enforceable.

---

### K5 — No Hidden or Unilateral Rule Changes

Charities frequently reallocate funds without notice.

Result:
Material changes require disclosure.

---

### K6 — Fail-Open Behavior

Fail-open requires disclosure of:
- allocation rule invoked,
- category of use,
- deviation from stated purpose.

Fail-open does not require disclosure of beneficiary identities.

Result:
Accountability without exploitation.

---

## Failure Modes Identified

Under 512, the following practices fail:

- moral laundering of funds,
- discretionary reallocation without notice,
- pressure to donate without clarity.

---

## What Breaks First

The kernel remains intact.

What breaks:
- trust-by-virtue,
- moral authority without disclosure,
- opacity justified by altruism.

---

## Conclusion

512 does not reduce generosity.

It removes moral immunity from accountability.

---

## Verdict

The kernel survives.

Charity systems must be honest or visibly fork.

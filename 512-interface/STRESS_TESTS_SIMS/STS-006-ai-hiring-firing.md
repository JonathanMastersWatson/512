# STS-006 — AI Hiring and Firing Systems

## Simulation Type
Adversarial stress test

## Domain
Labor / Employment / Algorithmic Decision Systems

## Objective
Test whether the 512 Kernel can constrain automated employment decisions
without forcing disclosure of proprietary models.

---

## Baseline System (Current Reality)

AI hiring systems often involve:
- opaque screening criteria,
- unchallengeable rejections,
- reputational permanence,
- no meaningful appeal.

---

## Adversarial Claim

“Transparency would enable gaming and reduce fairness.”

---

## Kernel Collision Analysis

### K1 — No Force or Fraud
Misrepresentation of fairness constitutes fraud.

---

### K2 — Voluntary Interaction
Applicants consent only to disclosed criteria.

---

### K3 — Exit Must Be Possible
Permanent exclusion violates exit.

---

### K4 — Explicit Contracts
Hiring criteria function as contracts.

---

### K5 — No Hidden Rules
Undisclosed scoring violates adherence.

---

### K6 — Fail-Open
Fail-open requires:
- rule category disclosure,
- rejection reason class,
- appeal or exit path.

---

## Conclusion

512 forces accountability, not model disclosure.

---

## Verdict

Kernel survives.
Black-box employment fails.

# Incentive Structure

## Purpose

This document defines how incentives operate in systems adhering to the
512 Kernel.

Incentives must align behavior without coercion.

---

## Voluntary Participation

All economic participation is voluntary.

No incentive mechanism may:
- compel participation,
- restrict exit,
- or impose undisclosed penalties.

Participation without exit violates adherence.

---

## Alignment Over Enforcement

Systems must rely on incentive alignment rather than enforcement
wherever possible.

Positive incentives are preferred to punitive mechanisms.

Economic pressure may not substitute for consent.

---

## Explicit Tradeoffs

All incentives must disclose:
- what behavior is rewarded,
- what costs are incurred,
- and what risks are borne.

Hidden tradeoffs violate adherence.

---

## Symmetry

Incentives must be symmetric.

No party may:
- externalize risk without disclosure,
- privatize upside while socializing downside,
- or impose asymmetric loss.

---

## Failure and Exit

Participants must be able to:
- cease participation,
- settle outstanding obligations,
- and exit without retaliation.

Exit is an economic right.

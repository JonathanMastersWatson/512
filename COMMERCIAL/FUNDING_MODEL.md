# Funding Model

512 uses a prepaid funding model for settlement events.

Funds are allocated in advance to cover future commitment settlements.

---

## Typical Funding Pattern

Example:
- Organization allocates: $1,000–$5,000 USD annually
- Funds converted into settlement units
- Settlement units consumed incrementally as commitments occur

No dynamic funding is required during normal operations.

---

## Accounting Treatment

- Treated as operating expense
- Not held for appreciation
- Not customer funds
- Not revenue-bearing

Comparable to:
- transaction fees
- audit tooling
- compliance services

---

## Controls

Organizations MAY:
- cap annual settlement spend
- monitor per-unit cost
- alert on abnormal usage

No automatic escalation occurs without explicit authorization.

# 512 Linguistic Interpretations — Manifest

This document enumerates a set of **subordinate linguistic interpretations** of the 512 Kernel.

These documents:
- restate the kernel in different linguistic styles,
- preserve intent and outcome,
- have no independent authority,
- do not amend, replace, or supersede the canonical kernel.

The canonical kernel remains frozen at genesis commit  
`4f5bc5de1dd1dc1d69cd173a9e43a954af0da16d` (tag `v1.0.0-genesis`).

## Authority Boundary

This manifest establishes **set membership only**.

It does not:
- grant authority to any interpretation,
- assert equivalence to the kernel,
- define precedence between interpretations,
- or introduce new constraints.

Interpretations may be added in future sets without altering this manifest.

---

## Anchoring Intent

This manifest is intentionally structured to be:
- hashable as a single artifact,
- independently verifiable,
- cryptographically linkable back to the canonical kernel.

Anchoring this manifest binds the **entire interpretation set** to a point in time without freezing the kernel or privileging any single rendering.

---

Language is allowed to live.  
Authority must remain frozen.

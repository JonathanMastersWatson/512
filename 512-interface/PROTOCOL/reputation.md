# Reputation Protocol

## Purpose

This document defines how reputation operates in systems adhering to the
512 Kernel.

Reputation is informational.
It is not coercive.

---

## Voluntary Participation

Participation in reputation systems must be voluntary.

No interaction may be conditioned on mandatory reputation scoring
unless explicitly agreed by all parties.

---

## Transparency

Reputation signals must be transparent in origin and meaning.

Systems must disclose:
- what signals contribute to reputation,
- how signals are weighted or aggregated,
- and how reputation affects interaction.

Opaque reputation systems violate adherence.

---

## Non-Coercion

Reputation may inform choice.
It may not compel behavior.

Reputation systems must not:
- trap participants,
- impose undisclosed penalties,
- or function as de facto enforcement mechanisms.

---

## Contestability

Participants must be able to:
- view reputation data about themselves,
- contest inaccuracies,
- and understand how reputation is derived.

---

## Separation from Identity

Reputation is distinct from identity.

Systems must not assume permanence or irreversibility of reputation.

Exit from a reputation system must be possible.

---

## Optionality

No system component may require reputation as a prerequisite
unless explicitly declared in advance and consented to.

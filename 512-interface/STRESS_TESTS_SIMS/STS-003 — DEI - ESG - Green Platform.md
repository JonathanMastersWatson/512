# STS-003 — DEI / ESG / Green Platforms

## Simulation Type
Adversarial stress test

## Domain
Institutional Platforms / Ideological Governance

## Objective
Test whether the 512 Kernel can constrain ideology-driven platforms
without prohibiting value-based participation.

---

## Baseline System (Current Reality)

DEI, ESG, and green platforms commonly exhibit:

- ideological criteria embedded as defaults,
- opaque scoring and compliance systems,
- moral framing used to suppress dissent,
- asymmetric enforcement,
- reputational penalties without contestability.

Ideology functions as hidden authority.

---

## Adversarial Claim

“These systems are values-based.  
They cannot be reduced to neutral rules without undermining their purpose.”

---

## Kernel Collision Analysis

### K1 — No Initiation of Force or Fraud

Ideological enforcement becomes fraud when presented as neutral
compliance or technical necessity.

Result:
Value-based enforcement must be declared explicitly.

---

### K2 — Voluntary Interaction and Consent

Participation must be voluntary.

Result:
Mandatory ideological compliance without explicit opt-in violates consent.

---

### K3 — Exit Must Be Possible

Participants are often penalized for non-compliance or exit.

Result:
Exit must be possible without undisclosed reputational or economic punishment.

---

### K4 — Explicit and Enforceable Contracts

Ideological criteria function as contractual terms.

Result:
Criteria must be readable, referenceable, and equally enforceable.

---

### K5 — No Hidden or Unilateral Rule Changes

Scoring frameworks often evolve silently.

Result:
Criteria changes must be disclosed before application.

---

### K6 — Fail-Open Behavior

Fail-open requires disclosure of:
- ideological criteria invoked,
- scoring category applied,
- compliance threshold crossed.

Fail-open does not require disclosure of scoring models.

Result:
Contestability without gaming.

---

## Failure Modes Identified

Under 512, the following practices fail:

- moral criteria hidden as technical standards,
- silent expansion of ideological scope,
- coercive compliance framed as virtue.

---

## What Breaks First

The kernel remains intact.

What breaks:
- ideological laundering,
- unaccountable moral authority,
- forced consensus through opacity.

---

## Conclusion

512 does not prohibit value-driven platforms.

It requires them to:
- declare values explicitly,
- require explicit opt-in,
- and permit exit without retaliation.

---

## Verdict

The kernel survives.

Ideology must choose transparency or fork openly.

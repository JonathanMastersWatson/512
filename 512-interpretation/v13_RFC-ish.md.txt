## Constraint Definitions (RFC-style)

### 1. Non-Aggression and Non-Fraud
An agent **MUST NOT** initiate force or fraud against any human.

---

### 2. Voluntary Interaction
All interactions between agents and humans **MUST** be voluntary and initiated only with explicit consent.

---

### 3. Revocability of Consent
Consent **MUST** be revocable at any time.  
Systems **MUST** permit immediate exit without penalty or obstruction.

---

### 4. Contract Explicitness and Symmetry
All contracts governing interaction **MUST** be explicit, human-readable, and equally enforceable by all parties.

---

### 5. Rule Transparency
No rules governing interaction **MAY** be hidden, implicit, or unilaterally modified after consent is granted.

---

### 6. Fail-Open Behavior
On failure, systems **MUST**:
- reveal governing rules and conditions, and
- default control to human choice.

---

### 7. Compliance Condition
Claims of adherence **MUST** satisfy all constraints simultaneously.  
Partial or conditional compliance **MUST NOT** be represented as adherence.

# CHANGELOG

## Purpose

This file records **structural and documentary changes** to the 512 research archive.

It exists to:
- preserve historical integrity
- prevent silent revisionism
- allow reviewers to track evolution

---

## [2025-12-26] — Initial Canonical Archive Freeze

### Added
- Full `/512-papers/` canonical sequence
- README.md (repository orientation)
- PROVENANCE.md
- INTERPRETATION_GUIDE.md
- CITATION_POLICY.md
- FAILURE_MODES.md
- TERMS.md
- REVIEWER_FAQ.md

### Defined
- Canonical paper numbering
- Discovery timeline (log-derived)
- Explicit non-goals and exclusions

### Notes

## Change Policy

- Substantive conceptual changes require a new dated entry
- Clarifications may be added, but original text is not retroactively altered
- Historical discovery documents are immutable

---

## Versioning Note

This repository does not follow semantic versioning.

Changes are historical, not product-based.

---

## Status

This changelog marks the **first frozen public research state** of the 512 archive.

# Why the XRP Ledger (XRPL)

The XRP Ledger is used as a settlement and anchoring layer, not as a
computation platform.

It was selected for the following reasons:

- Deterministic finality
- Low, predictable transaction costs
- Public auditability
- Conservative protocol governance
- Long-term operational stability

XRPL is not used to:
- execute rules
- enforce behavior
- store documents
- manage identities

It is used only as a neutral public witness.

The choice of XRPL is practical, not ideological.

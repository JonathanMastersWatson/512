# Technical Overview: 512 as a Constraint Layer

## Definition

512 is a **minimal execution-time constraint layer**.

It is not:
- a protocol
- a platform
- a runtime
- a control system

---

## Core Properties

512 is defined by being:
- minimal (512 bytes)
- non-ownable
- voluntary
- execution-adjacent
- enforcement-free

---

## Execution vs Settlement

A foundational distinction:

- **Execution** occurs locally, in real time
- **Settlement** records irreversible commitments

512 governs neither execution nor settlement.
It constrains the **legitimacy boundary** between them.

---

## Fail-Open Principle

512-compatible systems must:
- continue operating if 512 is unavailable
- not block execution
- not enforce compliance

Failure must reduce legitimacy signaling, not halt action.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

512 does not include:
- identity
- permissions
- policy logic
- behavioral rules

Any system that does is not implementing 512.

---

## Technical Neutrality

512 is compatible with:
- multiple compute architectures
- multiple settlement rails
- multiple media systems

It mandates no stack choices.

# 512 Embeddings — Manifest

This document enumerates a set of **executable language embeddings** derived from the 512 Kernel.

These files are intended for use in:
- agent system prompts,
- policy layers,
- runtime guards,
- refusal logic,
- and workflow enforcement.

They **do not** carry authority and **do not** modify, replace, or extend the canonical kernel.

The canonical kernel remains frozen at genesis commit  
`4f5bc5de1dd1dc1d69cd173a9e43a954af0da16d` (tag `v1.0.0-genesis`).

## Embedding Set (Current)

| ID | File | Execution Context | Purpose |
|----|------|-------------------|---------|
| EMB-01 | agent-guard-core.md | agent / system | Core refusal and non-coercion logic |
| EMB-02 | conflict-resolution.md | agent / workflow | Rule collision and ambiguity handling |
| EMB-03 | consent-lifecycle.md | system / workflow | Consent grant, revoke, erase, exit |
| EMB-04 | refusal-templates.md | agent / UI | Standardized refusal language |
| EMB-05 | runtime-checks.md | runtime / audit | Boolean compliance checks |

---

## Execution Boundary

These embeddings:
- are **replaceable**,
- are **context-specific**,
- may evolve independently,
- and are expected to change over time.

Changes to these files **do not** affect:
- kernel authority,
- interpretation meaning,
- or lineage records.

Only the kernel defines constraints.

---

## Relationship to Interpretations and Lineage

- **Interpretations** explain constraints to humans.
- **Lineage** records how language evolved pre-genesis.
- **Embeddings** instruct systems how to behave under constraints.

No embedding supersedes interpretation.  
No interpretation supersedes the kernel.

---

## Anchoring Intent

This manifest is intentionally structured to be:
- hashable as a single artifact,
- independently verifiable,
- cryptographically linkable back to the canonical kernel.

Anchoring this manifest binds the **embedding set as a whole** to a point in time without freezing individual files or the kernel itself.

---

Language is allowed to live.  
Authority must remain frozen.

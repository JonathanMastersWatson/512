# Why the Sell Side Pays the Settlement Cost

Under 512, the party asserting finality bears the settlement cost.

This is intentional.

---

## Reputation Asymmetry

In most commercial relationships:
- buyers can walk away,
- sellers must defend claims over time.

The cost of ambiguity falls disproportionately on the seller.

512 aligns settlement cost with reputational risk.

---

## Historical Precedent

Sellers already pay for:
- payment processing
- chargeback protection
- compliance audits
- legal enforcement

512 replaces opaque costs with explicit, minimal settlement receipts.

---

## Buyer Impact

Buyers:
- do not prepay settlement fees
- do not hold settlement assets
- receive verifiable proof of consent and terms

This increases buyer trust without increasing buyer cost.

---

## Summary

Buyers consume trust.
Sellers must prove it.

Settlement cost follows responsibility.

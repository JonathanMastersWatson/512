# Data Sovereignty Architecture

## Purpose

This document defines how data ownership and control are preserved
within systems adhering to the 512 Kernel.

Data sovereignty is structural, not aspirational.

---

## Ownership Model

Data ownership follows declared principals and explicit agreement.

By default:
- data belongs to the principal on whose behalf it was generated.

Ownership may be delegated by contract.
Ownership may be revoked by consent withdrawal.

---

## Separation of Concerns

Systems must separate:

- data storage,
- data processing,
- and data control.

No component may assume ownership by proximity or custody.

---

## Access Control

Access to data must be governed by explicit consent and scope.

Systems must be able to demonstrate:
- who accessed data,
- under what authority,
- and for what purpose.

---

## Portability

Users must be able to:

- export their own data,
- in a usable format,
- without technical obstruction.

Portability is a prerequisite for exit.

---

## Retention and Deletion

Data retention must be disclosed.

Where deletion is possible, it must be:
- user-initiated,
- verifiable,
- and timely.

Where deletion is not possible, the reason must be disclosed.

---

## No Silent Reuse

Data collected for one purpose must not be reused for another
without renewed consent.

Scope creep violates adherence.

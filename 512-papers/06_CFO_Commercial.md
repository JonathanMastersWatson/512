# 512 — CFO and Commercial Perspective

## Status

This document is explanatory only.
It does not define a revenue model.

---

## Overview

512 introduces a minimal settlement cost to externalize proof of
commitment.

This cost functions as an operating control, not a financial product.

---

## Cost Characteristics

Settlement costs are:
- event-based
- predictable
- prepaid
- expensed as operating cost

They scale with commitment volume, not transaction value.

See:
- `COST_EXAMPLES.md`
- `FUNDING_MODEL.md`

---

## Accounting Treatment

Settlement units are:
- not held for appreciation
- not customer funds
- not balance-sheet assets

Comparable to:
- transaction fees
- audit tooling
- compliance services

---

## Why the Sell Side Pays

The party asserting finality bears the cost.

This aligns cost with reputational and enforcement risk.

See:
- `WHY_SELL_SIDE_PAYS.md`

---

## Risk Reduction

512 reduces:
- contract disputes
- audit friction
- evidence production cost

A single avoided dispute can exceed years of settlement costs.

---

## Summary

512 replaces ambiguity with receipts.
The cost is negligible.
The risk reduction is material.
